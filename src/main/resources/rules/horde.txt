Horde Chess:
All pieces move as in orthodox Chess.
Description:
White wins if he/she captures all black pieces.
Black wins if he/she checkmates the white king.
If no black piece can make a valid move, the game is a draw (stalemate).
Black pawns can be promoted to a black queen,
rook, bishop or knight if they reach the last row (from black's point of view).
Black pawns cannot move two spaces forward from any position,
except the second rank (from black's point of view).
